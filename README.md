# Welcome to my Project 4 page.

## Project 4 consisted of:
- Creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. Creating all of the code to work with the data source using a code module, and test the code module code using provided testing code. Also creating a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb.
